00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.420
OK, so I'm screwing it up.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.620
I don't want to, I just wish that I knew what I could do to...

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Nigel?

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.500
Nigel, Nigel.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.900
No.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.760
I don't know what you expect me to do.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.120
There's nothing in this whole closet that will fit a size six.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.420
I can guarantee you.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.020
These are all sample sizes two and four.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.140
All right. We're doing this for you. And-
-A poncho?

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.920
You'll take what I give you and you'll like it.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.720
We're doing this Dolce for you.

00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:50.560
And shoes

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.820
Jimmy Choo's.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.680
- Manolo Blahnik.
- Wow.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.500
Nancy Gonzalez. Love that.

00:00:59.501 --> 00:01:01.940
Okay, Narciso Rodriguez.
This we love

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.600
- Uh, it might fit. It might.
- What?

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.400
Okay. Now, CHANEL. You're in desperate need of CHANEL.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.780
Darling, shall we?

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.320
We have to get to the beauty department, and God knows how long that's going to take.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.400
I mean, I have no idea why Miranda hired her.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.800
Me neither. The other day,
we were in the beauty department,

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.940
She held up the Shu Uemura eyelash curler and said,
"what is this?"

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.120
I mean, I just knew from the moment I saw her,

00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:32.680
she was going to be a complete and utter disaster.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.220
Miranda Priestly's office.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.860
No, actually she's not available,
but I'll leave a word.

00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:50.180
OK, thanks. Bye.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.920
How did-

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.800
Are you wearing the Ch-

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.900
The CHANEL boots? Yeah, I am.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.320
You look good.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.580
What?

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.979
She does.

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.220
Oh, shut up, Sue.
