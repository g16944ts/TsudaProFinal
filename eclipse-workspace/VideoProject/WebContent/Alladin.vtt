00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.850
You are quite the magician, thank you.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:15.768
No. I can't believe what.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:23.950
I can't believe we did that that I did that,

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.970
that that were alive at the chase T.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.810
T. Thank you. And thank you for getting me out

00:00:33.937 --> 00:00:35.080
of there.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.425
Aladdin isn't it. You're welcome,

00:00:39.554 --> 00:00:45.970
I'm I'm dalia. Dia. From the Palace.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.610
How could you tell? Well,

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.982
only someone from the Palace get afford a bracelet like

00:00:51.043 --> 00:00:53.985
that an that soak lining is imported to it comes

00:00:54.047 --> 00:00:55.150
from the merchant,

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.680
both straight to the Palace but.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.360
Not the servants. At least not most servants,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.380
which means you. Are hand made to the Princess?

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.739
Impressive, think that's impressive. You should see the city from

00:01:09.806 --> 00:01:10.410
up there.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:20.830
Agrapha It's so beautiful I should get out more.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.380
You should tell the Princess to get out more.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.220
The people haven't seen her in years.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.520
They won't let her. Ever since my.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.680
The Queen was killed. The sultan's been afraid,

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.180
so she's kept locked away.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.760
Seems everyone's been afraid since then,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.801
but the people have argued about had nothing to do

00:01:41.862 --> 00:01:42.470
with that.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.650
The people love their. They did,

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.310
didn't they? Is this yours?

00:01:49.310 --> 00:02:03.490
It's kind of borrowed. My mother told me that song.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.560
Mine too. So I remember.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.680
And what about your father?

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.900
I lost them both when I was young.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.200
Been on my own ever since.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.310
It's alright, it's just what.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.048
It's a little sad. Having a monkey is the only

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.730
parental authority in your life.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.370
We get by. Every day I just.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.880
Think things will be different,

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.660
but it never seems to change.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.860
Sometimes I feel like I'm trapped.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.630
Like you can't escape that you were born into.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:54.126
Yes. I have to get back to the Palace now.
